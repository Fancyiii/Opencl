# Opencl

I found the solution, as it is going to be usual from now on, by asking ChatGPT. To set up OpenCL on WSL, you can follow these general steps:(https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/6951)

Install a Linux distribution in WSL, such as Ubuntu, and make sure it is up to date.
Install OpenCL driver for your GPU. You can download the appropriate driver from the GPU vendor's website and follow the installation instructions.
Install the OpenCL development package, which contains the necessary libraries, headers, and tools to develop OpenCL applications. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal:
```
sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
```
Install an OpenCL implementation, such as the open-source OpenCL runtime from the Khronos Group called "POCL." You can install POCL by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install pocl-opencl-icd
```
Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point to the OpenCL libraries. You can do this by adding the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

After completing these steps, you should be able to use OpenCL on WSL. Note that the specific steps and packages required may vary depending on the Linux distribution, GPU hardware, and OpenCL implementation you are using.
